There are specs in src directory. You have to replace every lodash in these files to make the tests passes.

If you don't want to see all the tests, you can launch them by type like this:
 - `npm run test:types`
 - `npm run test:functions`
 - `npm run test:classes`
 - `npm run test:closures`
 - `npm run test:this`
 - `npm run test:string`
 - `npm run test:array`
